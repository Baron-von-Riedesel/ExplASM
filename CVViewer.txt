
This dll works only in conjunction with COMView 1.7.0+ or OLEView. It has to
be registered with regsvr32 and will show interface IShellFolder in a bit
more detail.

An object which exposes interface IShellFolder is CLSID "desktop" for example.

Source code is included, so you may add more interfaces to the viewer.
That's very simple. Just do

- add code for your interface viewer somewhere in CVViewer.asm
- add a call of your new viewer code in proc "View" in CVViewer.asm
- add some data for registry stuff. Search for "RegKeys_CVViewer" in 
  CVViewer.asm and copy these 2 lines:
	REGSTRUCT <-1, 0, CStr("Interface\{000214E6-0000-0000-C000-000000000046}")>
	REGSTRUCT <CStr("OLEViewerIViewerCLSID"), 0, -1>
  In the first line there is the IID of the interface your new viewer is
  for and this has to be modified accordingly. The second line should be
  left unchanged.
