
 ExplorerASM

 ExplorerASM is an explorer application written in assembly.

 From a technical point of view this app consists of:
 - a simple window with a treeview client. The treeview is filled 
   from IShellFolder clients, the root of which is received from 
   function SHGetDesktopFolder.
 - an IShellBrowser object to let the views created communicate with 
   the application. 

 The original purpose of this app was to provide a test platform for 
 self-written shell namespace extensions. But of course if you want 
 you may use it as explorer "substitute" (possibly after some enhancements). 
 But be cautious: some features are (still) missing and some
 features of original explorer are undocumented. In no case rename ExplASM.exe
 to explorer.exe!


 Restrictions

 Option "Include Browsable Items" doesn't work in windows 98. If activated, 
 selecting a file in treeview will terminate the application.


 Building Binary
 
 The assembly source is written in Masm syntax, it has been tested with
 JWasm and Masm. The WinInc include files are used, which may be found at
 http://github.com/Baron-von-Riedesel/WinInc.
 A Makefile (NMAKE) is supplied as well to build the binaries. Please note
 that besides ExplASM.EXE there will a dll be build. This is an "interface"
 viewer for interface IShellFolder, to be used by COMView or OLEView only.
